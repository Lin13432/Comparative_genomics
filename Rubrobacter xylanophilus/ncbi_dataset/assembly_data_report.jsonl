Each base pair has a minimum q (quality) value of 30 and the total error rate is less than one per 50000.\nThe JGI and collaborators endorse the principles for the distribution and use of large scale sequencing data adopted by the larger genome sequencing community and urge users of this data to follow them. It is our intention to publish the work of this project in a timely fashion and we welcome collaborative interaction on the project and analysis.\n(http://www.genome.gov/page.cfm?pageID=10506376)","currentAssemblyAccession":"GCF_000014185.1","genbankAssmAccession":"GCA_000014185.1","pairedAssembly":{"accession":"GCA_000014185.1","annotationName":"Annotation submitted by DOE Joint Genome Institute","status":"current"},"pairedAssemblyAccession":"GCA_000014185.1","refseqAssmAccession":"GCF_000014185.1","refseqCategory":"representative genome","submissionDate":"2006-06-09","submitter":"DOE Joint Genome Institute"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":1,"contigN50":3225748,"gcCount":"2273397","numberOfComponentSequences":1,"numberOfContigs":1,"numberOfScaffolds":1,"scaffoldL50":1,"scaffoldN50":3225748,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":1,"totalSequenceLength":"3225748","totalUngappedLength":"3225748"},"organismName":"Rubrobacter xylanophilus DSM 9941","strain":"DSM 9941","taxId":266117}
