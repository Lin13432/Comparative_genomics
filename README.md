# Comparative_genomics
1.	Introduction 
In this study, Prosthecochloris aestuarii and Rubrobacter xylanophilus were subjected to comparative genomic analysis. Orthologs were found between protein sequences from two different species using the Best Bidirectional Hits (BBH) method, and a phylogenetic tree was created by aligning the homologs of one example of orthologs. Speciation and Duplication events were marked on the tree, which was compared with a species tree based on rRNA resources. Multiple Sequences Alignment (MSA) was applied in the end to identify conserved regions in protein sequences and potential promotor regions in DNA sequences.
